# Code-Refactor-for-Accessibility

In this exercise I wanted to make this site example more accesible.  

My goal was for anyone who accesses the site using assistive technology like screen readers to be able to successfully navigate the site.

In this excercise I learned some best practices for making a site more accessible.  

I refactored the code to include semantic HTML elements to be more specific about what each section is for or its positioning on the page.

I added alt tags to my images so that the image could be described to someone who cannot see the pictures.

I added a description in the title element.

I also worked to ensure the CSS sheet was more concise.
